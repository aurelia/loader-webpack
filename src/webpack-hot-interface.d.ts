   * The HMR is waiting for your call the check(). When you call it the status will change to check.
   * 
   * - `check`
   * The HMR is checking for updates. If it doesn’t find updates it will change back to idle. If updates were found it will go through the steps prepare, dispose and apply. Than back to idle.
   * 
   * - `watch`
   * The HMR is in watch mode and will automatically be notified about changes. After the first change it will change to watch-delay and wait for a specified time to start the update process. Any change will reset the timeout, to accumulate more changes. When the update process is started it will go through the steps prepare, dispose and apply. Than back to watch or watch-delay if changes were detected while updating.
   * 
   * - `prepare`
   * The HMR is prepare stuff for the update. This may means that it’s downloading something.
   * 
   * - `ready`
   * An update is available and prepared. Call apply() to continue.
   * 
   * - `dispose`
   * The HMR is calling the dispose handlers of modules that will be replaced.
   * 
   * - `apply`
   * The HMR is calling the accept handlers of the parents of replaced modules, than it requires the self accepted modules.
   * 
   * - `abort`
   * A update cannot apply, but the system is still in a (old) consistent state.
   * 
   * - `fail`
   * A update has thrown an exception in the middle of the process, and the system is (maybe) in a inconsistent state. The system should be restarted.
